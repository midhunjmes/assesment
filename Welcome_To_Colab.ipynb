            "\n",
            "The `__init__` function is a special method in Python classes, known as a constructor. This function is automatically called when an object of the class is instantiated. In this specific implementation, the `__init__` function initializes an object with a specified `battery_capacity`. This suggests that the class is likely designed to represent a device or entity that has a battery, such as an electric vehicle, a smartphone, or any other battery-powered device.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Parameters\n",
            "\n",
            "* **`self`**: This is a reference to the current instance of the class and is used to access variables and methods from the class. It is passed automatically when the method is called, so it does not need to be explicitly provided when calling the method.\n",
            "* **`battery_capacity`**: This parameter specifies the capacity of the battery. The unit of measurement (e.g., kWh for electric vehicles or mAh for smaller devices) is not defined in the function signature but should be consistent based on the context in which this class is used.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Usage Example\n",
            "\n",
            "Given that this function is a constructor, its usage involves creating an instance of the class. Assuming the class is named `BatteryPoweredDevice`, an example usage would look like this:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "class BatteryPoweredDevice:\n",
            "    def __init__(self, battery_capacity):\n",

            "**Parameter Explanation:**\n",
            "   - `self`: This is a reference to the current instance of the class. It allows the function to access and modify the attributes of the specific object being created.\n",
            "\n",

            "   - `model`: This parameter represents the name of the vehicle model. It should be a string value.\n",
